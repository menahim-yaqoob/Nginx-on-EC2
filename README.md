üåê NGINX Web Server Deployment on AWS EC2 with GitHub Integration
This project outlines the deployment of a robust NGINX web server on an Amazon EC2 instance, coupled with comprehensive version control and collaboration facilitated by GitHub. It serves as a foundational blueprint for hosting static web content or acting as a reverse proxy for more complex applications in a cloud environment.

üöÄ Project Overview
The core objective of this initiative is to establish a scalable and accessible web serving infrastructure using industry-standard tools. By leveraging AWS EC2 for compute resources and NGINX for efficient content delivery, this project demonstrates fundamental cloud deployment practices. All associated configuration files, web assets, and deployment scripts are meticulously managed within a dedicated GitHub repository, ensuring version control, collaborative development, and streamlined updates.

‚ú® Key Features & Components
AWS EC2 Instance: Utilizes Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for scalable virtual server provisioning.

NGINX Web Server: Deploys and configures NGINX for high-performance static content serving and potential future use as a reverse proxy.

Git & GitHub: Implements Git for local version control and GitHub for remote repository hosting, enabling code collaboration, change tracking, and release management.

Secure Access: Configures SSH for secure remote access to the EC2 instance.

Web Accessibility: Ensures the NGINX server is publicly accessible via HTTP (and optionally HTTPS) through properly configured AWS Security Groups.

Automated Setup (Optional): Incorporates User Data scripts for automated NGINX installation during EC2 instance launch, promoting Infrastructure as Code principles.

üéØ Purpose
This project is designed to:

Demonstrate proficiency in cloud infrastructure deployment on AWS.

Showcase expertise in configuring and managing the NGINX web server.

Illustrate best practices for version controlling infrastructure and application code using Git and GitHub.

Provide a reproducible environment for learning and experimenting with web server setups in the cloud.

Serve as a starting point for more advanced deployments, including CI/CD pipelines, load balancing, and SSL integration.
